# Compilers - While Language
While language is simple and a bit similar to assembly that I developed during the course work to grasp the main concepts of Compilers


## Lexical Analysis
Lexical analysis i.e. the allowed words and key words that we can use in the Language is done in **While.l file** where Lexical fundament is

## Syntactical Analysis
Syntactical Analysis i.e. the allowed sentential forms and sentences(statements,loops, etc) that we can use in the Language is done in **While.y file** where Syntactical tree is written

## Semantical Analysis a.k.a. assembly code generation
Semantical Analysis i.e. the allowed functionality that the Language provides(written on an assembly) is in **While.y** file as well.
